# Ward Graph
Open-source graph tool for exploring blockchain transactions with a focus on compliance and risk analysis.

## About this project
The graph tool is based on an API provided by Ward Analytics. This API calculates the risk score and activity with other entities, allowing for the instant calculation of stats like direct and indirect exposure to entities like Binance or address categories like Mixers or Phishing/Hacking-related addresses.

You can try it out here: https://www.wardanalyticsapp.com
