# Ward Graph

An open-source graph tool for exploring blockchain transactions with a focus on compliance and risk analysis.

## About this project

The graph tool is based on an API provided by Ward Analytics. This API calculates the risk score and activity with other entities, allowing for the instant calculation of stats like direct and indirect exposure to entities like Binance or address categories like Mixers or Phishing/Hacking-related addresses.

**You can try it out here:** https://www.wardanalytics.app

## Features

- Graph visualization of blockchain interactions between addresses
- Current Blockchains: Ethereum
- Thorough mapping of addresses to entities (exchanges, mixers, scams, etc.)

## Implementation

The project uses the following technologies:

- Typescript
- React
- ReactFlow
- TailwindCSS
- Vite

## Roadmap

- New blockchains: Bitcoin, Tron, Polygon, XRP.
- Improvements to the UIUX
- Improvements to the expansion algorithm heuristic

## Dataset

- We will make most of our dataset used in the Graph completely public on Hugging Face & Kaggle in the near future, while updating it regularly. Links will be available here.
